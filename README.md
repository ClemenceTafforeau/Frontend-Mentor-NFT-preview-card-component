## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned how to use pseudo-classes. I also learned how to overlay elements.

### Continued development

I really struggled with combining overlaid elements and the active pseudo-class.

### Useful resources

- [Yoksel's URL Encoder](https://yoksel.github.io/url-encoder/) - This helped me with encoding one of the svgs provided with this project.
- [Kevin Powell's Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@KevinPowell) - As always, very useful ressource for beginners like me, especially regarding the use of Flexbox.
